Perform a linear projection, multiply, and apply LeakyReLU.

## Input
- Tensor `input` of shape $(B, F_{in})$
- Matrix `weight` of shape $(F_{out}, F_{in})$
- Vector `bias` of shape $(F_{out})$

## Output
- Tensor `output` of shape $(B, F_{out})$

## Notes
- This problem is adapted from [KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench/blob/main/KernelBench/level2/12_Gemm_Multiply_LeakyReLU.py)
