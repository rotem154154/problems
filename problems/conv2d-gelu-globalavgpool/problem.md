Perform Conv2D, GELU, and global average pooling.

## Input
- Tensor `input` of shape $(B, C_{in}, H, W)$
- Tensor `kernel` of shape $(C_{out}, C_{in}, K_h, K_w)$
- Tensor `bias` of shape $(C_{out})$

## Output
- Tensor `output` of shape $(B, C_{out})$

## Notes
- This problem is adapted from [KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench/blob/main/KernelBench/level2/67_Conv2d_GELU_GlobalAvgPool.py)
