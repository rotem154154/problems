Perform ConvTranspose3D, scale, BatchNorm, and global average pooling.

## Input
- Tensor `input` of shape $(B, C_{in}, D, H, W)$
- Tensor `kernel` of shape $(C_{in}, C_{out}, K_d, K_h, K_w)$
- Tensor `conv_bias` of shape $(C_{out})$
- BatchNorm weights/biases of shape $(C_{out})$

## Output
- Tensor `output` after global average pooling

## Notes
- Global average pooling outputs shape $(B, C_{out}, 1, 1, 1)$.
