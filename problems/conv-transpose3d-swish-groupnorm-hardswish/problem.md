Perform ConvTranspose3D, Swish, GroupNorm, and HardSwish.

## Input
- Tensor `input` of shape $(B, C_{in}, D, H, W)$
- Tensor `kernel` of shape $(C_{in}, C_{out}, K_d, K_h, K_w)$
- Tensor `conv_bias` of shape $(C_{out})$
- GroupNorm weights/biases of shape $(C_{out})$

## Output
- Tensor `output` after HardSwish

## Notes
- This problem is adapted from [KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench/blob/main/KernelBench/level2/60_ConvTranspose3d_Swish_GroupNorm_HardSwish.py)
