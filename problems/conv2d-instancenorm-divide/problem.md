Perform Conv2D, apply InstanceNorm, and divide by a constant.

## Input
- Tensor `input` of shape $(B, C_{in}, H, W)$
- Tensor `kernel` of shape $(C_{out}, C_{in}, K_h, K_w)$

## Output
- Tensor `output` of shape $(B, C_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})$

## Notes
- This problem is adapted from [KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench/blob/main/KernelBench/level2/17_Conv2d_InstanceNorm_Divide.py)
