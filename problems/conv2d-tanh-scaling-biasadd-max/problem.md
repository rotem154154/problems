Perform Conv2D, tanh, scaling, bias add, and max pooling.

## Input
- Tensor `input` of shape $(B, C_{in}, H, W)$
- Tensor `kernel` of shape $(C_{out}, C_{in}, K_h, K_w)$
- Tensor `conv_bias` of shape $(C_{out})$
- Tensor `add_bias` of shape $(C_{out}, 1, 1)$

## Output
- Tensor `output` after max pooling

## Notes
