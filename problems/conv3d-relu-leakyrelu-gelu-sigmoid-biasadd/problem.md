Perform Conv3D followed by ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU, Sigmoid, and bias addition.

## Input
- Tensor `input` of shape $(B, C_{in}, D, H, W)$
- Tensor `kernel` of shape $(C_{out}, C_{in}, K_d, K_h, K_w)$
- Tensor `bias` of shape $(C_{out}, 1, 1, 1)$

## Output
- Tensor `output` of shape $(B, C_{out}, D_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})$

## Notes
- This problem is adapted from [KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench/blob/main/KernelBench/level2/7_Conv3d_ReLU_LeakyReLU_GELU_Sigmoid_BiasAdd.py)
