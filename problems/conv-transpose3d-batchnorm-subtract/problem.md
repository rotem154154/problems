Perform ConvTranspose3D, BatchNorm, and subtract the spatial mean.

## Input
- Tensor `input` of shape $(B, C_{in}, D, H, W)$
- Tensor `kernel` of shape $(C_{in}, C_{out}, K_d, K_h, K_w)$
- BatchNorm weights/biases of shape $(C_{out})$

## Output
- Tensor `output` after subtraction

## Notes
- This problem is adapted from [KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench/blob/main/KernelBench/level2/15_ConvTranspose3d_BatchNorm_Subtract.py)
