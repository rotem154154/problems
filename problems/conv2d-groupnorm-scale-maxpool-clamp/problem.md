Perform Conv2D, GroupNorm, scaling, max pooling, and clamp.

## Input
- Tensor `input` of shape $(B, C_{in}, H, W)$
- Tensor `kernel` of shape $(C_{out}, C_{in}, K_h, K_w)$
- Tensor `conv_bias` of shape $(C_{out})$
- GroupNorm weights/biases of shape $(C_{out})$
- Tensor `scale` of shape $(C_{out}, 1, 1)$

## Output
- Tensor `output` after clamp

## Notes
- This problem is adapted from [KernelBench](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench/blob/main/KernelBench/level2/85_Conv2d_GroupNorm_Scale_MaxPool_Clamp.py)
